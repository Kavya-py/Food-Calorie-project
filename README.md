  #**Nutrition Analysis Project:**
A simple, data-driven exploration of everyday foods — calories, protein, and even water intake.
#**About the Project:**
This repository contains my data analysis notebook where I explore the nutritional profile of different foods using Python and visualizations.
The goal was to understand how calories, protein, and water content influence healthy eating patterns.
**What This Project Includes:**
Cleaning and analyzing the dataset
Visualizations for:
  1. Highest/lowest calorie foods
  2. Protein-rich foods
  3. Scatter plots (Protein vs Calories)
  4. Water intake–based comparison
Key health insights drawn from the analysis
**Tech Stack**
  1. Python
  2. Pandas
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Seaborn
  5. Jupyter Notebook
**Contents**
  1. Nutritient_Analysis.ipynb – full analysis
  2. Visualizations (PNG files)
**Why This Matters**
  This project highlights how simple nutritional metrics can help guide better eating habits. Small changes like choosing hydrating foods or protein-dense options can have a meaningful impact on overall wellness.
